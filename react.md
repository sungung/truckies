# ReactJS

## Create React App
npx create-react-app my-app && cd my-app
npm start

## Install firebase
npm install firebase
npm install -g firebase-tools


### Deploy to Production
`npm run build` will create an optimised build in the build folder


## Context
- Study https://formidable.com/blog/2021/react-composition/
- Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
- I you only want to avoid passing some props through many levels, component composition is often a simpler solution than context.
